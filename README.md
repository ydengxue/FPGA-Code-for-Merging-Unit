This is a FPGA Code for Merging Unit. It supports such modules as IRIG-B decoding, PPS decoding, FT3 decoding, time holding, bus to MCU, system clock synchronization, and so on. In every module, there are status registers that for MCU to read and debug (An idea came from the peripherals of MCU).
 
The code is compiled by Xilinx ISE V12.8 or above. It has been tested on Xilinx FPGA XC3S400AN-5FGG400.
